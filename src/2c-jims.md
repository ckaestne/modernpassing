# Jim's Patterns (sync)

Prerequisite: [Basic Synchronous Passing Patterns]() | Next: [Four-handed siteswaps]() or [advanced synchronous patterns]().

Jim's patterns are a common variation for basic synchronous patterns that mess with the timing and the hand sequence and turns one-sided patterns into ambidextrous patterns. The basic idea is that one passer will throw crossing passes, while the other passer keeps throwing straight passes. As a consequence passers will sometimes receive an incoming pass to a hand that they do not expect, but they fix it by quickly throwing that wrong hand, which is known as a *hurry*.

**Jim's three-count.** If passer B throws crossing passes, passer A will receive their first pass to the right hand, rather than to the left. Hence, they throw their first self also from the right hand, very quickly after just having thrown a right-handed pass; their next pass is again from the right hand. Notice the hands in this diagram, the hurries are highlighted, and the passes happen in a right-right-left-left sequence.

Even with the hurries, both passers should throw passes and selfs at roughly the same time. The pattern is synchronous and simply fudges the timing by rushing two throws from the same hand. It is also possible to throw the pattern as a four-handed siteswap without hurries, but with time for a flip, as we will show among the [beginner four-handed siteswaps]()

**Jim's four-count and two-count.** The same idea of crossing passes, turns the one-sided four-count and two-count patterns into ambidextrous patterns with hurries. Here is the diagram and hand sequence for Jim's two-count.

<crossreference>*Jim's two-count* is compatible with *why not* (see below) and can be useful to stabilize the pattern when learning why not.</crossreference>


**Brainstorming (Jim's ppsps).** This pattern is a tricky milestone for many passers, that may not be physically hard but requires a lot of concentration. It is a long sequence that only repeats after 20 beats. Rather than memorizing the entire sequence, just count the pass-pass-self-pass-self sequence (aloud) and throw those regardless of which hand is next.

**Why not.** The pattern *why not* is another popular after-the-basics pattern for many passers. It can be considered as a trick throw in *Jim's two-count:* It also has one passer throw crossing single passes, but instead of the hurried self the passer throws a heff-zip combination with a hurried zip. Rather than fudging the timing in a synchronous pattern, we recommend to learn why not as a four-handed siteswap and explain it there under [heffs]().

**Other patterns to try:** Every synchronous pattern can be *jimsified* by throwing a club to the wrong hand with the receiver reacting with a hurry. Jim's one-count turns into a fairly fast sequence with many hurries, Jim's pass-pass-self turns into a one-sided pattern, Jim's countdown requires a lot of patience. It is possible to cross only some but not all passes or even to throw some doubles or selfs to the wrong hand. Also both passers can decide whether and when to throw crossing passes, though this is collision prone without coordination. There are no additional standard patterns, but there is a huge space for experimentation.
