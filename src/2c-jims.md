# Jim's Patterns (sync)

Prerequisite: [Basic Synchronous Passing Patterns]() | Next: [Four-handed siteswaps]() or [advanced synchronous patterns]().

Jim's patterns are a common variation for basic synchronous patterns that mess with the timing and the hand sequence. They turn one-sided patterns into ambidextrous patterns. The basic idea is that one passer will throw crossing passes, while the other passer keeps throwing straight passes. As a consequence passers will sometimes receive an incoming pass to a hand that they do not expect, but they fix it by quickly making the next throw from that wrong hand instead. This forced, quick action from the same hand is known as a *hurry*.

**Jim's three-count.** If passer B throws crossing passes, passer A will receive their first pass to the right hand, rather than to the left. Hence, they throw their first self also from the right hand, very quickly after just having thrown a right-handed pass; their next pass is again from the right hand. Notice how the hands do not always alternate in this diagram â€“ the hurries are highlighted. Overall, each passer always has two right-handed passes and then two left-handed passes before the pattern repeats.

Even with the hurries, both passers should throw passes and selfs at roughly the same time. The pattern is synchronous and simply fudges the timing by rushing two throws from the same hand. It is also possible to throw the pattern as a four-handed siteswap without hurries, but with time for a flip, as we will show among the [beginner four-handed siteswaps](4b-4hsw-beginner.md)

**Jim's four-count and two-count.** The same idea of crossing passes, turns the one-sided four-count and two-count patterns into ambidextrous patterns with hurries. Here is the diagram and hand sequence for Jim's two-count.

<crossreference>*Jim's two-count* is compatible with *why not* (see below) and can be useful to stabilize the pattern when learning *why not*. There are also 7-club versions of both that change sides with a hurry after every three double passes.</crossreference>


**Brainstorming (Jim's pass-pass-self-pass-self).** This pattern is a tricky milestone for many passers. It may not be physically hard, but it requires a lot of concentration. It is a long sequence that only repeats after 20 beats. Rather than memorizing the entire sequence, just count the pass-pass-self-pass-self sequence (aloud) and make those throws those regardless of which hand is next.

**Why not.** The pattern *why not* is another popular after-the-basics pattern for many passers. It can be considered as a trick throw in *Jim's two-count:* Instead of the hurried self the passer throws a heff-zip combination with a hurried zip. Rather than fudging the timing in a synchronous pattern, we recommend to learn [*why not* as a four-handed siteswap](4d-4hsw-heffs.md).

**Other patterns to try:** Every synchronous pattern can be *jimsified* by throwing a club to the wrong hand with the receiver reacting with a hurry. For example, *Jim's one-count* is fast sequence with many hurries; *Jim's pass-pass-self* turns out to be a one-sided pattern; *Jim's countdown* requires a lot of patience. It is possible to cross only some but not all passes or even to throw some doubles or selfs to the wrong hand. Also both passers can decide whether and when to throw crossing passes, though this is collision prone when done without coordination. None of the variations beyond the ones described above are very common, but there is a huge space for experimentation.
