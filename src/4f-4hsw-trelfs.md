# Trelfs

Prerequisites: [Reading Four-Handed Siteswaps]() & [Beginner four-handed siteswaps]() | Next: Add [doubles]() and [heffs]() and look for combinations among [common named patterns]().

Trelfs are triple selfs, introducing the artificial term to distinguish them from triple passes. They are common in solo juggling, for example, the solo siteswap 543 with single, double, and triple spins is a good solo practice pattern.

**5-count popcorn (7a666).** A well-known, popular 7-club pattern. Some might find it easier to first throw *trelf-self* as a trick instead of *heff-heff* in *78686* (see [heffs]()). Note that the trelf is always the same club.

<siteswap>7a666</siteswap>

**a77.** This 8-club pattern is substantially harder since there are two trelfs in the air at any time.

<siteswap>a77</siteswap>

A decent warmup pattern is 7a274:

<siteswap>7a274</siteswap>

**Other patterns to try.** *74a*, *7a2a6* (popcorn variation), *aa7* (9-club three-count).
