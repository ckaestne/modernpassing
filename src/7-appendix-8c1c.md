# Appendix: 8-club one-counts

There are many ways to juggle 8-club one-count, scattered through several chapters. This tries to collect them in one place:

* Singles vs doubles -- Four-handed siteswap 79, see [compatible siteswaps]()
  * both straight or both crossing (i.e., swapping A and B positions)
* Zaps vs triples -- Four handed siteswap 5b
* Crossing doubles -- Synchronous pattern 4p, see [advanced synchronous patterns]()
  * usually crossing, but straight also possible
* Single, double, triple -- Synchronous pattern 3p4p5p
  * trick throw in crossing doubles or run continously
* Crossing singles -- Synchronous pattern 4p, thrown with singles, see [advanced synchronous patterns]()
* Straight singles -- Synchronous pattern 4p, thrown with singles, see [advanced synchronous patterns]()
  * Alternating hands or throwing left and right synchronously
  * Various lanes, e.g., all inside vs all outside, inside-outside, inside-inside-outside-outside, both hands passing left/right of all incoming passes, ...
* Blinky -- Synchronous left and right hand passes from passer B, see [beyond classic synchronous patterns]()
  * Straight and crossing
  * Async passer can switch between straight and crossing at any time
  * Throw 8 to change sides in blinky
