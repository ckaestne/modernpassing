# Beginner four-handed siteswaps 

Prerequisites: [Reading Four-Handed Siteswaps]() & [Learn to pass / teach to pass]() | Helpful: [Sync 6-club one-count]() and [ppsps]() | Next: Add [doubles](), [heffs](), or [zaps]().

**5-club one-count (744 and 726).** Note how 5-club one-count (from [learn to pass]()) is actually the four-handed siteswap 744

<siteswap>744</siteswap>

When you get more comfortable with the pattern, try flipping the 4s or throw self-zip instead:

<siteswap>726</siteswap>

**Parsnip (77722).** Another good beginner pattern is *parsnip*. Notice that we often automatically do zips without noticing them; it might be easier to focus on the passes, of which there always be three from the same hand, before changing sides.

**Martin's one-count (77772).** If you are comfortable with *parsnip,* add a club, resulting in 4 passes and a (fairly automatic) zip.

<siteswap>77772</siteswap>

**7-club one-count (7).** Now add another club and leave out the zips. Especially the crossing singles should be lofty. If you drop a club continue in *77772*, if you drop another one, continue in *77722* or *77272*.

**Mild madness (7777266).** A well known juggling pattern, often juggled synchronously with fudged timing, makes a nice easy sideswap with selfs.

**Jim's three-count, async (7746666).** An four-handed siteswap version of Jim's three count (see [Jim's patterns]()) without a hurry. Notice the extra time for a flip after every second pass from the asynchronous nature of four-handed siteswaps. (There are siteswap version for all Jim's patterns)

**Other similar patterns to try.** 77272, 774, 77466 (Jim's two-count), 7742744, 7747746
