# Advanced synchronous patterns

Prerequisite: [Basic Synchronous Passing Patterns]() | Next: [Four-handed siteswaps]() or [tedious synchronous patterns]().

**TODO: change to 3/3p notation**

There are many more variations of synchronous patterns, especially when exploring 7-club and 8-club patterns. They are still all synchronous in that both passers throw at the same time, but they may not both make the same throw or throw from the same hand.

We already introduced *early doubles* as a crossing double pass in [basic synchronous patterns](). Those are a good way to practice double passes. In fact, continuous early doubles in *6-club three-count* (after a first normal pass) are a good way to practice doubles with both hands:

<sync>3p3 -> 33p3, 4p23</sync>

<!-- psspsspsspsspss
psdfsdfsdfsdfsd -->

**7-club two-count.** Many passers learn *7-club two-count* as a milestone. Being one-sided, I consider this traditional passing, not modern passing and recommend the four-handed siteswap *7-club three-count* instead (see four-handed siteswaps with [doubles]()).

The conventional setup is the following: Both passers, throw straight double passes with every right hand; passer A starts with four clubs and a double pass as the first throw; passer B starts with three clubs and a double pass on the *second* beat. That is, passer B throws a right-hand pass when passer A throws a left-handed self.

<sync style='{"flipStraightCrossing": true}'>4p,o -> 34p,4p3</sync>

<!-- //TODO the x notation is not great, since it's just the pattern flipped, not an individual decision about one pass

When learning 7-club two-count aim for consistent passes. Since both passers cannot see their passes land, provide feedback on placement and spin. Remember the spot on the ceiling where the first club peaks, and try to throw all following passes that they peak in the same place. Consistency is usually more important than the exact placement. 

<crossreference>See also the galloped version *7-club two-count on singles* (see [beyond synchronous patterns]()). Also consider *7-club three-count* (966, see [doubles]()) or *7-club one-count* (see [learning to pass]()) for a more modern introduction to seven club patterns.</crossreference>


**A tiny bit of theory.** Why are early doubles crossing when doubles in *7-club two-count* are straight? Why do passers start on different beats in *7-club two-count?* 

The patterns are indeed from the same family. By default, passers in synchronous patterns both start with the same hand and throw their singles straight and their doubles crossing. However, it is also possible to throw singles crossing and doubles straight, when one passer starts with the opposite hand.

The most natural approach for 7-club two-count would be for both passers cross their doubles and for both passers to start at the same time with a right hand throw (actually a fairly nice pattern for one passer to practice left-handed doubles):

<sync style='{"flipStraightCrossing": false}'>4p3,34p</sync>

<!-- dsdsdsdsds
sdsdsdsdsd -->

By flipping straight and crossing passes, we get a pattern with straight doubles, but where passer B starts with a left-handed self. In practice, most passers leave out that first left-handed self to start on a right-handed pass one beat later.

<sync style='{"flipStraightCrossing": true}'>4p3,34p</sync>
<!-- dxsdxsdxsdxsdxs
sdxsdxsdxsdxsdx -->

**7-club four-count.** To explore one-sided triple passes, 7-club four-count is a common, albeit boring, pattern.

<sync>5p333,335p3</sync>

**6-count popcorn.** One of several one-sided popcorn patterns, named after the trelfs that pop up on alternating sides. Can also be thrown with heff-heff instead of trelf-self.

<sync style='{"flipStraightCrossing": true}'>4p33353,3534p33</sync>
<!-- dssstsdssstsdsssts
tsdssstsdssstsdsss -->

<crossreference>See 5-count popcorn with heffs ([heffs]()) or trelfs ([trelfs]()) for an ambidextrous version.</crossreference>


**7-club pass-pass-self.** With odd-length patterns, there are no synchronous patterns where both passers throw the same sequence. The most common 7-club pass-pass-self pattern has passer A throws single-double-self and passer B throws double-self-double (pds vs dsd):

<sync>3p4p3,4p34p</sync>

<!-- pdspdspds
dsddsddsd -->

Another common variation is double-self-single versus single-double-heff:

<sync>4p33p,3p4p4</sync>
<!-- dspdspdsp
pdhpdhpdh -->

As discussed above, all of these can be also passed with crossing single passes and straight double passes if one passer starts left-handed.

Other variations of *7-club pass-pass-self,* often with one side being substantially harder than the other, are:

* 3p 3 3p vs 4 4p 4p
* 3p 3p 4 vs 4p 4p 3
* 3p 3p 4 vs 4p 4 3p
* 3 3p 4p vs 5 3p 3p
* 3p 3p 4 vs 5 3p 3p
* 4p 4p 1 vs 4p 5 3p

In the [appendix](), we list a few more patterns with triple passes.

<crossreference>See 8-club pass-pass-self (996) for a balanced pattern on all doubles ([doubles]()).</crossreference>


**7-club synchronous three-counts.** For three-counts that are not [four-handed siteswaps](4c-4hsw-doubles.md), there are many possible variations that again combine two different throw sequences; none of them are common patterns:

* 3p 3 4 vs 4 4 3p
* 3p 4 4 vs 4p 3 3
* 3 4 4p vs 4p 3 3 
* 3 3p 3 vs 4p 4 4
* 3 3p 3 vs 5 3p 4

In the [appendix](), we list a few more of these patterns.

<crossreference>Try also *techno* in [beyond synchronous patterns] and 7-club three count (966, [doubles]()) and french three-count (786, see [heffs]()).</crossreference>


**8-club patterns (not two-count).** For eight clubs there are obvious sequences of doubles and heffs that mirror standard 6-club patterns: *dhh* (8-club three count), *ddh* (8-club pass-pass-self), *d* (8-club one count), and *dhhh* (8-club four count). These are usually passed with crossing doubles. For passers used to 9s in four-handed siteswaps it may be useful to lower the double passes a bit.

<crossreference>Try also 8-club pass-pass-self as a siteswap with only one person crossing (996, see [doubles]()) and 8-club one-count on singles versus doubles (97, see [8-club one-counts]()).</crossreference>
