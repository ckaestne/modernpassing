**7-club three-count (966).** A good pattern to practice doubles. Provide feedback about incoming doubles (e.g., over/under-spun, short/long, high/low, wide/narrow). As the pattern gets more stable, try to look down to see your passes land.

**7-club Jim's two-count (9964966).**

**972.** A great pattern to combine singles and doubles, one of them crossing, so both thrown to the same hand ("stacks"). Note: Juggler A starts with one club in the right hand and two in the left.

**Not likely (96672).** Doubles in period-5 patterns can be tricky, make sure they are lofty and use the self-zip-self to stabilize.

**Funky bookends friend (96677).** Harder version of *not likely*, keep the double high.
