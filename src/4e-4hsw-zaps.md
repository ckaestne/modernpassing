# Zaps

Prerequisites: [Reading Four-Handed Siteswaps]() & [Beginner four-handed siteswaps]() | Next: Add [doubles](), [heffs](), or [trelfs](), or introduce [takeouts]().

Zaps are low, fast passes that only spin half a rotation. The open a whole new group of interesting patterns. Look at a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyLoK-KhxQ) or an [animation](https://passist.org/siteswap/564?jugglers=2) for examples. They are usually thrown with an extended arm, letting the club slide down to the knob, without any spin from the wrist, aiming quite a bit behind the person catching the zap. Most of these patterns do not have commonly used names and are simply known by their numbers.

**Getting started (56464).** This is a great warmup pattern to learn and practice zaps. Hold the 4s and think of it at *self-self-zap-wait-wait*, starting with the *self-self* when it is necessary to free a hand to catch the zap. The zap is always the same club and there is plenty of time to watch the throw.

Once this is stable, replace the *wait-wait* with a *self-zip* (56662) to make it feel like an actual juggling pattern. Throw the self from the hand that did *not* just throw the zap.

**Killer bunny (564).** The next good practice pattern is shorter and slightly more challenging -- think of it as *self-zap-hold* or *self-zap-flip*. Once the pattern is more stable, flipping rather than holding the club will help with timing.

**552, 522, and 5.** Nice warm-up patterns to lean into zaps with 4, 3, and 5 clubs. In 522, try doing one of the zips behind the back. 5 is simply a very fast one-count with 5 clubs.

**756.** This a well-known 6-club pattern and a great milestone in combining zaps and singles. Each passer throws a zap and then a single (a "stack") to the *same* hand (crossing one of the passes), and then, after a self, a zap and a single to the other hand. Ensure the zaps are fast and the singles are lofty.
