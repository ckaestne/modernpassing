# Basic 6-club synchronous passing patterns

Prerequisites: [Learning to pass](1-learn-teach.md) | Next: [Jim's patterns](2c-jims.md), [7-club and 8-club synchronous patterns](2d-advanced.md), [tedious patterns](2e-tedious.md), or [four-handed siteswaps](4a-4hsw-notation.md) 

In all these 6-club patterns, both passers start with two clubs in the right and one club in the left hand. Both passers start at the same time with a straight single pass. It is customary to synchronize the start with an *up-down-pass* sequence where both passers lift the club without throwing it.

**6-club four-count (pass-self-self-self) and two-count (pass-self).** *Four-count* (old name *every others*) and *two-count* (old name *everies*) are probably the most common pattern used as a basis for group patterns, trick throws, and performances, but they are both one-sided, with all passes thrown from the right hand. I consider them as traditional passing, not modern passing. In *four-count* ever other right-hand throw is a pass.

In *two-count* every right-hand throw is a pass; the left hand only throws selfs.

**6-club one-count.** The 6-club one-count from [learning to pass]() (also known as *ultimates*, old name *thundershower*) is the easiest synchronous pattern for beginners to learn when they have a stronger passer as partner, because all throws are the same. Both passers pass from their right hand at the same time and then again from the left hand at the same time.

**6-club three-count (pass-self-self).** A good pattern to introduce selfs ofter one-count is *three-count* (old name *waltz*) with both passers counting pass-self-self. The pattern is ambidextrous, so has both right-hand and left-hand passes. Note that two clubs are always passed and the other clubs are always selfed – each club received as a pass gets thrown back as a pass again. Using two clubs of a different color to highlight the passes can help beginners remember when to pass.

**Pass-pass-self, bookends (pass-pass-self-pass-self), and countdowns.** Any other sequence of passes and selfs is possible. *Pass-pass-self* (old name *two-thirds-count*), *pass-pass-self-pass-self* (known as *bookends*), and various *countdowns* are common sequences to introduce some challenges. The countdown *pass-self-self-pass-self-pass-pass-self* can be remembered as the sequence three-count, two-count, one-count, two-count. Another common countdown is to start with a four-count and count down to a one-count and back up for the ambidextrous pattern *pass-self-self-self-pass-self-self-pass-self-pass-pass-self-pass-self-self*.

**Early doubles and triples.** In all patterns (except one-count), instead of a self-pass combination, we can throw a *crossing* double pass  followed by a wait (or flip) – that is, replace any *3 3p* with *4p 2*. This works because the double is thrown one beat before the single pass would have been and is thrown to the same hand. For the receiving passer, if the double is thrown well, this should not make a difference – the early double can be thrown to replace any single pass and does not need to be announced. It may require some practice though to get the timing and placement right.

The same idea also works with triple passes. Any self-self-pass combination can be replaced with a straight triple pass and two waiting beats (triple-flip-flip) – that is replace any *3 3 3p* with *5p 2 2*.

<sync style='{"emphasizeThrows": [8,9,10,11,12,13], "iterations": 1}'>3p33 3p33 3p33 3p33,3p33 3p5p2 233 3p33</sync>

When first learning doubles and triples, focus on throwing them high and at the same distance as the singles. Again, avoid spinning clubs from the wrist – if the pass arrives underspun, add height from moving the entire lower arm.

**Variations on selfs.** As solo jugglers might know, every two selfs can be replaced by heff-flip (as in solo siteswap 342) and every three selfs can be replaced by trelf-self-zip or heff-heff-zip (as in solo siteswaps 531 and 441). These can be easily integrated as tricks in *three-count* and *four-count*.
