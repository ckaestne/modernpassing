# Basic Synchronous Passing Patterns

Prerequisites: [Learning to pass]() | Next: [Jim's patterns](), [advanced synchronous patterns](), [tedious patterns](), or [four-handed siteswaps]() 

In all these 6-club patterns, both passers start with two clubs in the right and one club in the left hand. Both passers start at the same time with a straight single pass. It is customary to synchronize the start with an *up-down-pass* sequence where both passers lift the club without throwing it.

**6-club four-count (psss) and two-count (ps).** Four-count (old name *every others*) and two-count (old name *everies*) are probably the most common pattern used as a basis for group patterns, trick throws, and performances, but they are both one-sided, with all passes from the right hand. I consider them as traditional passing, not modern passing. In four-count ever other right-hand throw is a pass, in two-count every right-hand throw is a pass; the left hand only throws selfs.

**6-club one-count (p).** The 6-club one-count from [learning to pass]() (also *ultimates* or old name *thundershower*) is the easiest synchronous pattern for beginners to learn when they have a stronger passer as partner, because all throws are the same. Both passers pass from their right hand at the same time and then again from the left hand at the same time.

**6-club three-count (pss).** A good pattern to introduce selfs ofter one-count is *three-count* (old name *waltz*) with both passers counting pass-self-self. The pattern is ambidextrous, so has both right-hand and left-hand passes. Note that two clubs are always passed and the other clubs are always selfed -- each club received as a pass gets thrown back as a pass again. Highlighting the passes with two clubs with a different color can help beginners remember when to pass.

**Pass-pass-self (pps), bookends (ppsps), and countdowns (psspspps).** Any other sequence of passes and selfs is possible. *Pass-pass-self* (old name *two-thirds-count*), *bookends,* and various *countdowns* are common sequences to introduce some challenges. The countdown psspspps can be remembered as the sequence three-count, two-count, one-count, two-count; it is also possible to start with a four-count and count down to a one-count and back up for the ambidextrous pattern pssspsspsppspss.

**Early doubles and triples.** In all patterns (except one-count), instead of a self-pass combination, we can throw a *crossing* double pass followed by a wait (or flip) -- that is, replace any *sp* with *df*. That is, the double is thrown one beat before the single pass would have been and is thrown to the same hand. For the receiving passer, if the double is thrown well, this should not make a difference -- the early double can be thrown at any time and does not need to be announced. It may require some practice though to get the timing and placement right.

The same idea also works with triple passes. Any self-self-pass combination can be replaced with a straight triple pass and two waiting beats -- that is replace any *ssp* with *tff*.

When first learning doubles and triples, focus on throwing them high and at the same distance as the singles. Again, avoid spinning clubs from the wrist and add height from the lower arm movement if passes arrive underspun.

**Trick selfs.** As solo jugglers might know, every two selfs can be replaced by heff-flip (as in solo siteswap 342) and every three selfs can be replaced by trelf-self-zip or heff-heff-zip (as in solo siteswaps 531 and 441). These can be easily integrated as tricks in *three-count* and *four-count*.
