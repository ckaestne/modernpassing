# Acknowledgements

This book tries to capture the current state and trends in the passing community. While I have observed the origins of some patterns while participating in that community, and several ideas or patterns can be attributed clearly to specific community members, it would be difficult to trace a comprehensive genealogy. Rather than selectively attributing some ideas or patterns where I happen to know the origin, I present this entire book as the collective knowledge of the community.

However, I would like to highlight a few specific contributions that were influential to me or where I explicitly borrowed teaching materials:

* Amiel Martin for developing and promoting the way of teaching passing with 5-club one count, described early in this book
* Brook and Cameron's workshop on holy grail
* Brook **TODO consistent last names?**'s workshop on improving siteswaps and Toto's workshop on improving passing generally
* Aiden Burn for the initial development for takeout notation and Ed for pushing that notation forward
* Christian **H.** for passist
