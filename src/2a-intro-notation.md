# Introduction to Synchronous Passing & Notation

Most traditional passing patterns, including *6-club four count*, *three-count*, and *pass-pass-self* as well as *7-club two-count* are synchronous patterns in that both jugglers throw at the same time. This is where a lot of people start passing,  though we recommend a different first pattern (see [learning to pass]()).

Many passers explore only a small number of traditional synchronous patterns, usually with many selfs and most or all passes from the right hand, making it harder only by adding more clubs. It is not surprising that many find this boring soon. But there is a large number of synchronous patterns to explore, both one-sided (e.g., *four-count*) and ambidextrous (e.g., *three-count*) patterns, and then there is also the whole world of [four-handed siteswaps](). 

## Notation

Understanding a specialized notation can, after some initial learning, make it easy to read and understand many different patterns much easier than trying to parse textual descriptions. There are many different notations and they are not used consistently, since they emphasize different things and some notations are overly complex for simple patterns. Here, we adopt a consistent notation based on solo siteswaps and visualize them in simple diagrams.

We use the following symbols for different throws:

| Symbol | Description     |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0 | Empty hand |
| 1 | Zip / hand-across: Directly handing a club from one hand to the other without throwing it |
| 2 | Flip / hold: Holding a club in a hand without throwing it or flipping it quickly |
| 3 | Self as in a normal cascade |
| 3p | Single-spin straight pass  |
| 3px | Single-spin crossing pass  |
| 3x | Heffling: A self to the same hand, like a single-spun heff or a lofty flip |
| 4 | Heff: A double-spun self to the same hand, as in a four-club solo fountain |
| 4x | Crossing double self, like a heff but changing hands |
| 4p | Double-spin crossing pass |
| 4px | Double-spin straight pass |
| 5 | Trelf: triple-self to the other hand |
| 5p | Triple-spin straight pass |

A pattern where both passers make the same throws at the same time can now be written as a sequence of throws, such as "3p 3 3" or just "3p33" for *6-club three-count* where both passers throw a single pass on every third beat. This can also be visualized as follows:

<sync>3p33</sync>

In such visualization, we show two rows, one row for each passer, with time progressing from left to right. Usually both passers start at the same time with the right hand and then alternate hands, as indicated with the "R" and "L" labels above the throws for right and left hand. The numbers on the left indicate how many clubs each passer has in their right and left hand ("right|left"), the "||" and "X" above a pass indicate whether that pass is straight (i.e., right to left or left to right hand) or crossing (i.e., right to right or left to left hand).
