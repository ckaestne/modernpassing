# Heffs

Prerequisites: [Reading Four-Handed Siteswaps]() & [Beginner four-handed siteswaps]() | Next: Add [doubles](), [zaps](), or [trelfs](), or introduce [takeouts]().

**Why not (78627).** *Why not* is probably the first pattern with heffs for most jugglers. It is a widely know 6-club pattern, with [lots of videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=why+not+club+passing+ija) and [good video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKvM23fexE). Many jugglers fudge the timing with a fast zip (like [Jim's patterns]()) and juggle it synchronously. The most common and easiest to learn start is to have juggler B start with two clubs and react to the first pass with heff-zip-pass-self-pass.

There is also a 5-club version (78622) and the similar pattern *not why* (72867).

**French three-count (786).** A very common 7-club pattern and a great foundation for many harder siteswaps.

**Funky bookends (77786).** Another common, well known pattern.

**5-count popcorn with heffs (78686).** While the original popcorn patterns arguably have [trelfs]() in them, this is a common easier version.

Notice that *french three count* (786), *5-count popcorn* (78686), and *7-count popcorn* (7868686) all follow a common idea.

**Vitoria (7778686).** Essentially a combination of funky bookends and popcorn, named after the city Vitoria-Gasteiz where EJC was held in 2009.

**Other similar patterns to try.** 72867 (not why), 72786 (maybe), 8677777 (Mojito), 7868686 (7-count popcorn), 7888882 (7-count popcorn variation).
