# Appendix: List of Siteswaps

The following list contains all four-handed siteswaps with throws up to an *a* and a length of up to 7 throws (excluding 0s, 1s, 3s, and local 4-4 sequences). The patterns are grouped by length, compatibility interface (see [compatible siteswaps]()), and number of clubs and are sorted by the highest throw. Note, the siteswaps here are normalized to start with the highest throw, which is not necessarily the best start for actually juggling the pattern (see [siteswap theory]()). 

The website https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/siteswaps.xhtml has a version of this list that can be filtered by throws.
